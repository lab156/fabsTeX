# TODO list for formal abstracts:
1. Get website up and running. 
    - Equip it with user-login functionality. 
    - Equip it with a support for bulk download of formal-informal statements. 
    - Provide a submissions page. 
    - Improve search functionality. 
    - Provide cross-referencing to Lean statements which are marked with the appropriate tag. 
    - Provide support for in-website code-snippets.
2. Integrate with Naproche-SAD (?)

# TODO (fabsTeX specific)
* Add tikz-cd support.
* Change CSS to match the formalabstracts.github.io website. 
* Add support for showing code snippets. Upon clicking the code snippet, it should take the user to the appropriate lines of the file in the appropriate github repo. 
* Add support for making a formalization app instead of the comments app.
